\begin{song}{The Drover's Dream}{Traditional}
	One \C{G}night when travelling sheep, my com\C{C}panions lay a\C{G}sleep\\
There wasn't a star to \C{A7}'lluminate the \C{D}sky\\
I was \C{G}dreaming, I suppose, for my \C{C}eyes were partly \C{G}closed\\
When a very strange pro\C{D}cession passed me \C{G}by\\
First there came a kangaroo, with his \C{D7}swag of blankets \C{Em}blue\\ 
A \C{G}dingo ran be\C{Em}side him for a \C{D7}mate\\
They were \C{G}travelling mighty fast, and they \C{C}shouted as they \C{G}passed\\ 
"We'll have to jog a\C{D}long, it's getting \C{G}late"
\bigskip\par
	The \C{G}pelican and the crane, they came \C{C}in from off the \C{G}plain\\
	To amuse the company \C{A7}with a Highland \C{D}Fling\\
	The \C{G}dear old bandicoot played a \C{C}tune upon his \C{G}flute\\
	And the native bears sat \C{D}round them in a \C{G}ring\\
	The drongo and the crow sang us \C{D7}songs of long a\C{Em}go\\ 
	While the \C{G}frill-necked lizard \C{Em}listened with a \C{D7}smile\\ 
	And the \C{G}emu standing near with his \C{C}claw up to his \C{G}ear\\ 
	Said, "That's the Funniest thing I've \C{D}heard for quite a \C{G}while" 

\bigskip\par

	The \C{G}frogs from out the swamp, where the \C{C}atmosphere is \C{G}damp\\
	Came bounding in and \C{A7}sat upon the \C{D}stones\\ 
	They \C{G}each unrolled their swags and pro\C{C}duced from out their \C{G}bags\\ 
The violin, the \C{D}banjo and the \C{G}bones\\
	The goanna and the snake, and the \C{D7}adder wide a\C{Em}wake\\
	With the \C{G}alligator \C{Em}danced "The Soldier's \C{D7}Joy"\\ 
	In the \C{G}spreading silky oak the \C{C}jackass cracked a \C{G}joke\\ 
	And the magpie sang "The \C{D}Wild Colonial \C{G}Boy" 

\bigskip\par

	Some \C{G}brolgas darted out from the \C{C}tea-tree all a\C{G}bout\\ 
	And performed a set of \C{A7}Lancers very \C{D}well\\ 
	Then the \C{G}parrot green and blue gave the \C{C}orchestra its \C{G}cue\\
To strike up "The Old Log \C{D}Cabin in the \C{G}Dell."\\
	I was dreaming, I suppose, of these \C{D7}entertaining \C{Em}shows\\ 
	But it \C{G}never crossed my \C{Em}mind I was a\C{D7}sleep\\ 
	Till the \C{G}Boss beneath the cart woke me \C{C}up with such a \C{G}start\\ 
	Yelling, "Dreamy, where on \C{D}earth are all the \C{G}sheep?" 
\end{song}
