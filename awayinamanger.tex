\begin{song}{Away in a Manger}{Traditional}
\C{C7} A\C{F}way in a manger, no crib for a \C{Gm}bed,\\
The \C{C7}little Lord \C{F}Jesus lay \C{G7}down his sweet \C{C}head.\\
\C{C7}The \C{F}stars in the bright sky looked down where he \C{Gm}lay,\\
The \C{C7}little Lord \C{F}Jesus a\C{Gm}sleep on \C{C7}the \C{F}hay.
\bigskip\par
The \C{F}cattle are lowing, the baby a\C{Gm}wakes,\\
But \C{C7}little Lord \C{F}Jesus, no \C{G7}crying He \C{C}makes.\\
\C{C7}I \C{F}love Thee Lord Jesus, look down from the \C{Gm}sky,\\
And \C{C7}stay by my \C{F}bed side, 'til \C{Gm}morning \C{C7}is \C{F}nigh.
\bigskip\par
Be \C{F}near me, Lord Jesus, I ask Thee to \C{Gm}stay,\\
Close \C{C7}by me for\C{F}ever and \C{Gm}love me, I \C{C}pray;\\
\C{C7}Bless \C{F}all the dear children in Thy tender \C{Gm}care,\\
And \C{C7}fit us for \C{F}heaven to \C{Gm}live with \C{C7}Thee \C{F}there.

\begin{song}{Frosty the Snow Man}{Someone}
\C{G}Frosty the Snow Man, was a \C{C}jolly happy \C{G}soul\\ 
With a \C{C}corn-cob pipe and a \C{G}button nose\\
and two \C{D}eyes made out of \C{G}coal.\\
\\
\C{G}Frosty the Snow Man, is a \C{C}fairy tale they \C{G}say\\
He was \C{C}made of snow but the \C{G}children know \\
how he \C{C}came to \C{D7}life one \C{G}day.\\
\\
There \C{C}must have been some \C{Bm}magic in that \C{Am}old silk hat they \C{G}found,\\
For \C{D}when they put it \C{Db}on his head he \C{Em}began to dance \C{D}around.\\
\\
Oh, \C{G}Frosty the Snow Man was a\C{C}live as he could \C{G}be,\\ 
And the \C{C}children say he could \C{G}laugh and play \\
just the \C{C}same as \C{D7}you and \C{G}me.\\
\\
\C{G}Frosty the Snow Man,  knew the \C{C}sun was hot that \C{G}day,\\
So he \C{C}said, "Let's run  and we'll \C{G}have some fun\\
now be\C{C}fore I \C{D7}melt a\C{G}way."\\
\\ 
\C{G}Down to the village, with a \C{C}broomstick in his \C{G}hand,\\
Running \C{C}here and there all a\C{G}round the square,\\
saying \C{C}"Catch me if \C{D7}you \C{G}can."\\
\\ 
He \C{C}led them down the \C{Bm}streets of town right \C{Am}to the traffic \C{G}cop,\\
And he \C{D}only paused a \C{Db}moment when he \C{Em}heard him holler, \C{D}"Stop!"\\
\\
\C{G}Frosty the Snow Man had to \C{C}hurry on his \C{G}way,\\
But he \C{C}waved good-bye, saying, "\C{G}Don't you cry;\\
I'll be \C{C}back a\C{D7}gain some \C{G}day."\\
